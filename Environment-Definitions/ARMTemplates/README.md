# ARM Deployments

This template folder contains a suite of templates deployed through Azure Resource Manager (ARM). ARM templates are currently in GA for Azure Deployment Environments, and available to deploy for all customers.

### What will be deployed?

You can deploy the following test templates to ADE:
- [Sandbox](./Sandbox/azuredeploy.json) Will deploy an empty environment, which implies generating a resource group for your environment, but with no resources.
- [WebApp](./WebApp/azuredeploy.json) Will deploy an environment to host a Web App.
